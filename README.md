# Minecraftn't java
## It ain't Minecraft

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/Khhs167/minecraftnt-java/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Khhs167/minecraftnt-java/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

This is just a dumb project I am pouring too much effort into.  
It is a Minecraft clone written in Java with online asset updating, Multithreading etc.  
Yet I am still to add a proper player controller.

If you came here, I'm so sorry for you.  

When running the project it *does* download a copyrighted terrain.png, I took some liberties and if mojang sees this,
hope it is okay!
